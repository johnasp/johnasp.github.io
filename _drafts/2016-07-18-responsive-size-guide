I have been tasked with creating a responsive style guide for the suite of mobile specific website for an ecommerece client I am working with at the moment.  For shits and giggles, I thought I'd (for once!) document the whole process to map out my development workflow from start to end.  

## Analyse business requirements

I work in an agile team where platform changes are released in montly sprints and the software we use to manage all our tasks and workflow is called Jira.  All the business requirements related to my task are in a ticket which has been created by an organisation business analyst so I simply login to Jira, look at the project board and open the ticket to access the requirements. Rivetting stuff so far eh, here's a pretty picture to illustrate:

The clients problem is that they currently do not have a size guide for any of their apparel products on their mobile specific websites and they want this feature adding.  They do have them for their desktop and tablet specific websites.  

## My approach

OK so I now know what I have to do, the question now is, the best way to approach solving the problem?  So I have to make a size guide for mobile specific websites. The client currently uses [WURFL](http://wurfl.sourceforge.net/) to load a specific optimised codebase when a certain device type hits the URL i.e. when an iphone hits the URL then load a codebase for mobile, if an ipad hits the URL then load a codebase specific for tablets, yadda yadda.
