I have been tasked with creating a responsive style guide for the suite of mobile specific website for an ecommerece client I am working with at the moment.  For shits and giggles, I thought I'd document the whole process to map out my development workflow from start to end.  

## Analyse business requirements

The first stop of any project is to obtain, analyse and understand the business requirements.  All the business requirements related to my task are in a Jira (a tool the team uses to faciliate Agile software releases) story, created by an business analyst. I simply login to Jira, look at the project board and open the ticket to access the requirements.

![Business requirements in the Agile story](http:/johnaspinall.co.uk/img/size-guide-requirements.jpg)

Having read the requirements contained in the ticket (see above), I can deduce the clients' problem is that they currently do not have a size guide for any products on their mobile specific ecommerce websites and they want this feature adding.  As you can see, I highlighted the specifics of the story and any areas I didn't fully understand, which I then contacted the BA directly to clarify the requirment.  

At this stage I always find it useful to create a concise list of requirements, mainly for my myself just to walk through and tick off as I go.  So for this project it is as follows:

1. Size guide link/button on product details page on all brands, with ability to toggle it on/off on a per brand basis. 
2. Modal which contains size guide.
3. List of size guide category panels, layed out in expand/collapse accordian. 
4. Content in each panel to be in fixed width table to be scrolled horizontally when content overflows it's container. 
5. Close modal icon.

**Other notes**
* This is to be a generic size guide used accross all categories

## My approach

OK so I now know what I have to do, the question now, is, the best way to approach solving the problem?  So I have to make a size guide for mobile specific websites. The client currently uses [WURFL](http://wurfl.sourceforge.net/) to load a specific optimised codebase when a certain device type hits the URL i.e. when an iphone hits the URL then load a codebase for mobile, if an ipad hits the URL then load a codebase specific for tablets, yadda yadda. 

This is fine then, I am only building for mobile devices, and the browser landscape on mobile devices tends to be more standards compliant than legacy desktop browsers so I can use CSS3 and HTML5 with confidence the vast majority of it will be supported.  Win. 

As this is only a relatively small project, rather than waste time wireframing and sketching this out, I'm going to delve straight into code and build a prototype in the browser, the code which I write can the be used for the production solution. Again saving more time.  I'll send the intial screens out early to the business for review for feedback.  I'm going to write the coded prototpe in Codepen as it's the best tool for the job.

## Prototype

So I need to build and accordian element, which is loaded in a modal upon click of a link. The accordian elements are to contain the following categories
