I have been tasked with creating a responsive style guide for the suite of mobile specific website for an ecommerece client I am working with at the moment.  For shits and giggles, I thought I'd document the whole process to map out my development workflow from start to end.  

## Analyse business requirements

The first stop of any project is to obtain, analyse and understand the business requirements.  All the business requirements related to my task are in a Jira (a tool the team uses to faciliate Agile software releases) story, created by an business analyst. I simply login to Jira, look at the project board and open the ticket to access the requirements.

Having read the requirements contained in the ticket (see above), I can deduce the clients' problem is that they currently do not have a size guide for any products on their mobile specific ecommerce websites and they want this feature adding.  As you can see, I highlighted the specifics of the story and any areas I didn't fully understand, which I then contacted the BA directly to clarify the requirment.  

At this stage I always find it useful to create an ![Evernote t0-to list ](http://www.evernote.com/l/AIEmVk5UUhRF5IC8EmhNNtuIcJxharavdEQ/) of requirements and keep this in view at all times and tick off as I go.  So for this project it is as follows:

1. A Size guide link on the product details page, with ability to toggle it on/off on a per brand basis. 
2. The size guide content will appear in a modal upon click of the link above.
3. List of size guide category panels, layed out in expand/collapse accordian. 
4. Content in each panel to be in fixed width table to be scrolled horizontally when content overflows it's container. 
5. Close modal icon.

OK so I now know what I have to do, the question now, is, the best way to approach solving the problem?  

## My approach

We are to be presenting wide and deep tables of data to the user who we know is to be acessing the content on a mobile device.  And there are to be five seperate sections of content.  As we are limited in screen width on a mobile device, it seems to me the best way to present this content is to split up each section into an accordian, and further split each sub-section of content into tabs. 

### Sketching

I did a rough hand sketch of my idea and presented this to the business analysts. There were happy with this design pattern so my next taks is to build this out into a working prototype and get this into the hands of the business and users relatively early in the process in order to validate the product.

#### Protoype

I am only building for mobile devices, and the browser landscape on mobile devices tends to be more standards compliant than legacy desktop browsers so I can use CSS3 and HTML5 with confidence the vast majority of it will be supported.  Win. 

As this is only a relatively small product, rather than waste time wireframing, I'm going to delve straight into code and build a prototype in the browser, the code which I write can the be used for the production solution. Again saving more time.  I'll send the intial screens out early to the business for review for feedback.  I'm going to write the coded prototpe in Codepen as it's the best tool for the job.


So I need to build and accordian element, which is loaded in a modal upon click of a link. The accordian elements are to contain the following categories
