I have been tasked with creating a responsive style guide for the suite of mobile specific website for an ecommerece client I am working with at the moment.  For shits and giggles, I thought I'd document the whole process to map out my development workflow from start to end.  

## Analyse business requirements

The first stop of any project is to obtain, analyse and understand the business requirements.  All the business requirements related to my task are in a Jira (a tool the team uses to faciliate Agile software releases) story, created by an business analyst. I simply login to Jira, look at the project board and open the ticket to access the requirements.

![Business requirements in the Agile story](http:/johnaspinall.co.uk/img/size-guide-requirements.jpg)

Having read the requirements contained in the ticket (see above), I can deduce the clients' problem is that they currently do not have a size guide for any products on their mobile specific ecommerce websites and they want this feature adding.  As you can see, I highlighted the specifics of the story and any areas I didn't fully understand, which I then contacted the BA directly to clarify the requirment.  

At this stage I always find it useful to create a concise list of requirements, mainly for my myself just to walk through and tick off as I go.  So for this project it is as follows:

1. Size guide link/button on product details page on all brands, with ability to toggle it on/off on a per brand basis. 
2. Modal which contains size guide.
3. List of size guide category panels, layed out in expand/collapse accordian. 
4. Content in each panel to be in fixed width table to be scrolled horizontally when content overflows it's container. 
5. Close modal icon.

## My approach

OK so I now know what I have to do, the question now is, the best way to approach solving the problem?  So I have to make a size guide for mobile specific websites. The client currently uses [WURFL](http://wurfl.sourceforge.net/) to load a specific optimised codebase when a certain device type hits the URL i.e. when an iphone hits the URL then load a codebase for mobile, if an ipad hits the URL then load a codebase specific for tablets, yadda yadda.
