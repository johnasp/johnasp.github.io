Web designer and developer on a freelance project to build a brochure website for the Regency Lodge.

The Regency Lodge is a secure hospital facility and my brief was to design and build the company a web site which mirrored their existing brand styles, to host the site and maintain its content.  

### Update

This website was built in around 2008, the company has since been taken over and, alas, the website is no more.  You can see the design I did from the pic above, very "Web 2.0" eh!
