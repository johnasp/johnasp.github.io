excerpt: A case study detailing how I planned and built my home podcast studio.
---     

I've had all my podcast studio equipment hidden away and packed up in boxes for nigh on two years now.  This boxing up has coincided with the sad demise of my beloved Blackpool Football Club  and the fans podcast I used to run with a few pals.  

My love of the club had been all but extinguished by the way the club is being run by it's owners, which in my opinion, was purely for the benefit of them and them alone.  This coupled with my general interest in professional football waning, were the reasons why I knocked the show on the head. In addition to potentially any one of us being sued by the club own owners for a flippant comment anyone on the show could make.  It just wasn't worth the time and effort ann more.  

I'd also lost the passion for football in general.  The money obsessed, greed culture that the Premier League has spawned has totally changed the fabric of English football in my opinion.  Just look at the teams heets of Premier League starting elevens each week, more often than not it is a list of eleven foreign mercenaries playing for the pound signs, not the badge, and certainly not for the fans.  

But following attending the recent Brett Ormerod testimonial at AFC Fylde this weekend reminded me off the all the many positive aspects of being a fan of Blackpool and that is the great people who follow it.  I have decided to put out a new show, purely for the fans and to help galvanise us in some small way in the hope that we can all return to the club we all love one day. 

We are the club, we are the fans and football without fans is nothing.  

The format and name of the new show will be formalised in due course, the next step is to get all the gear up again.  I thought it would be a fun exercise to document the whole process from start to end and, detailing my studio design decisions and explaining what plugs in where and why.

Right, so down to business.

## Planning the studio

### Picking a room 

I have a large garage in my new house which has had the door bricked up and has been double glazed so I think this is the best room in which to setup.  I could use my spare room which is a decent size, but I want the full studio setup which means a mic and seat for up to four people.  This means four mic boom arms, a mixer, mics, sound recorder and a shit load of cables!

I already have my home office setup in the corner of my spare room so I didn't want to ruin the "zen" of this space by installing a load of audio equipment and cables all over it. I won't lie, a podcast studio can make a bedroom look a mess and the Mrs' hated it and have to admit I didn't like seeing it all over our spare room.

It might get a bit chilly in the winter but that's what jumpers and gloves are for and I'm sure the spiders would appreciate some company!  My garage has power so I can always get one of the portable electric heaters, or hell even an oil powered radiator.     

There are also other reasons for picking the garage over a bedroom in the house.  The main reason being it is detached from the main house so affords a measure of privacy and sound isolation from the main house.  My three year old son will either by asleep or bursting in when show recordings would be in progress which would mean we'd either keep the noise down or halt recordings whilst he was ushered away!  Not ideal.  

Joking aside, cable management is going to be a key feature of this new studio build as I hate cable spaghetti and equipment clutter.  I want to create a "zen podcast studio" to help the creative juices flow!
