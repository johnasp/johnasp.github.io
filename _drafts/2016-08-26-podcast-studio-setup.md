excerpt: A case study detailing how I planned and built my home podcast studio.
---     

I've had all my podcast studio equipment hidden away and packed up in boxes for nigh on two years now.   This boxing up has coincided with the sad demise of my beloved Blackpool Football Club fans podcast I used to run with a few pals, but that's another story. 

Anyway, down to the business of setting up my studio again.  I thought it would be a fun excercise to document the whole process from start to end and to maybe help inspire someone else to setup a podcast and studio of their own. 

Right, so down to business.

### Planning the studio 

### Picking a room 

I have a large garage in my new house which has had the door bricked up and has been double glazed so I think this is the best room in which to setup.  I could use my spare room which is a decent size, but I want the full studio setup which means, four mic boom arms, a mixer, mics, sound recorder and a shit load of cables.  I already have my home office setup in the corner of the room along with my brand new stand up desk up desk from Ikea which I absolutely love so I didn't want to ruin the "zen" of this space by dumping a load of audio equipment and cables all over it. 

 I won't lie, it can make a bedroom look a mess and the other half won't like it one bit so the garage it is.  

It might get a bit chilly in the winter but that's what jumpers and gloves are for and I'm sure the spiders would appreciate some company!    

The space is large, it is isolated from the main house so affords a measure of privacy and sound isolation from the main house and I can make as much mess as I like there!  Joking aside, cable management is going to be a key feature of this new studio build as I hate cable spaghetti and equipment clutter.  I want to create a "zen podcast studio" to help the creative juices flow!  

 I could setup in the spare bedroom but it would be a tight fit
