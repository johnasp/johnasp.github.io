A very cool photo album creation tool. You can create impressive Flash and/or HTML photo albums, which can also integrate with Flickr, use GPS locations which links with Google Earth so you can see exactly where you took your photo! The majority of the features are free also.

See the cool Flash version of the Kleeneze [Marrakech Conference album](http://www.marrakech07.com/photo_gallery.htm) I created with JetPhoto.
