A nice little web design effect which seems to be doing the rounds at the moment  is to vertically &#8216;cut up&#8217;  web site regions (header, content, footer, etc) into differently coloured sections with decorative &#8216;teeth/zig zag/pinking&#8217; pattern as top and/or bottom borders.  The effect appears to be a digital abstraction from the craft of dressmaking, as the sections of the web site look like that have been cut up with a pair of [pinking shears]

I wanted to know how to make this effect myself in my design tool of choice namely, so I set about learning how to do it and thought I would share it with the world with this video screencast tutorial, enjoy!
