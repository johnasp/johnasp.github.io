A nice little web design effect which seems to be doing the rounds at the moment  is to vertically &#8216;cut up&#8217;  web site regions (header, content, footer, etc) into differently coloured sections with decorative &#8216;teeth/zig zag/pinking&#8217; pattern as top and/or bottom borders.  The effect appears to be a digital abstraction from the craft of dressmaking, as the sections of the web site look like that have been cut up with a pair of [pinking shears](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0001K9QXQ/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=B0001K9QXQ&linkCode=as2&tag=eborearevroo-21)<img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=eborearevroo-21&l=as2&o=2&a=B0001K9QXQ" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" />.
