<strong>Web designer, developer, CMS developer</strong> on project to redesign the Kleeneze corporate website and make it responsive.  The main goals of the project were 

1. Generate more new distributor leads 
2. Send traffic to the seperate eCommerce store
3. Optimise the site for mobile, tablet and desktop browsers  

Tasks completed included; production of wireframes and a rapid prototype, designed site mock-ups, coded the HTML & CSS (using responsive design) and co-worked to convert into a Wordpress theme, thus making the site content managed. 

I kept the most important aspects of the brief in mind when laying out the content in the wireframes. This being to generate as many new distrubtor sign ups as possible and to send traffic to the eCommerce store.  To achieve this I made two big buttons labelled "earn money" and "shop online" prominent on the website header.  I also mirrored these CTA's in the promotional image slider and also the ad module blocks below.

Responsive design was in its infancy in 2011 and to ensure I had the knowledge to build this site I read <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/2212673612/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=2212673612&linkCode=as2&tag=eborearevroo-21">"Responsive Web Design" by Ethan Marcotte</a> which helped me learn the coding methods required to build a responsive site.

The site has since had a couple of design iterations but you can view the archived version by clicking the image below.
