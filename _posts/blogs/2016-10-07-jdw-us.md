### The project

Digital transformation project in the form of a ground-up rebuild of all JD Williams' brand websites, converting all silod mobile, tablet and desktop specific websites in a single repsonsive site driven from a single codebase.

### My responsibilities 

The UI team was split into and responsible for production of specific sections of the site.  I was responsible the product details page (including size guides and product refinements), product list pages, sections of the shopping bag and the site menu navigation system.  Specific tasks and production responsibilities are detailed below:

* UI and visual design concepts. 
* Prototypes, coded and visual.
* User testing of prototypes
* Front end template build. 
* Production read code for page templates (HTML, CSS, SASS, Jquery)

I was also invloved in split A/B testing working with a business analyst to produce designs and code for multivariant pages using both Monetate and Hotjar.
