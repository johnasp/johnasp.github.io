It&#8217;s been a while since my tool post, just been doing a lot of tedious content work &#8211; oh well, needs must sometimes. Anyway, I have recently had the need to try and convert some of our old speeches from WMA to MP3 format due to the new audio player I am implementing on the Kleeneze Intranet.

I have found this ace and free tool called &#8216;Switch&#8217; which does the job quickly and with little fuss.
