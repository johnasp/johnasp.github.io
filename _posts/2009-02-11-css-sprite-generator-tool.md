[Using CSS Sprites technique](http://css-tricks.com/css-sprites-what-they-are-why-theyre-cool-and-how-to-use-them/) for loading page images can provide serious performance improvements for you web site as it vastly reduces the amount of HTTP requests between the browser and the server.&nbsp; The technique basically involves a single image file as a background image positioned in your element as a background image using negative margin coordinates.&nbsp; 

A great technique but the CSS can be a bit laborious to write but not with this ace tool [CSS Sprite Generator](http://spritegen.website-performance.org/)!&nbsp; Check it out.&nbsp; I used the technique and tool to create the side navigation menu on the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ViewTraffic.info">ViewTraffic.info</a> site I have recently built.
