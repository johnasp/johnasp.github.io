#### Overview

I was approached by the Blackpool Supporters Trust to help them create an online membership system for their organisation.  Their existing website didn't have the capabilities for its members to create and manage their membership accounts.  

The site also did not allow the site owners to manage the sites content so they needed a content management system.  I suggested they use Wordpress coupled with a Membership plugin which met the functionality of their requirements.  

#### What I did

1. Sourced and setup VPS web hosting using Digital Ocean.  
2. Configured the VPS with a LAMP stack and installed Wordpress
3. Researched membership websites and integrated Memberpress plugin to facilitate a fully functioning Membership system 
4. Designed a custom child Wordpress theme for the site design
5. Imported old membership user database into the new system via CSV file manipulation
