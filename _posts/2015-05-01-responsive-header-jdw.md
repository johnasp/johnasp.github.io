### Project Overview

The client was in the process of exploring the possible conversion of it's suite of silod (mobile-tablet-desktop) websites into a single responsive site.  

I was asked to build a fully functioning responsive prototype of the site header.  A requirement was to observe performance on mobile device so I decided the best way to achieve this was to build a prototype in the browser using the "mobile first" philosophy.  I coded the prototype direct in the browser using HTML, SASS and Jquery.  

#### Final result 

I took a screen recording of the final prototype in action which you can view below.  You can alternatively view the working prototype in your browser and device of choice by <a href="http://johnasp.github.io/ecommerce_responsive_header/">clicking this link</a>.
