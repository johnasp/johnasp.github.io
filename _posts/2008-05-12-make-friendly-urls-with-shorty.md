<span class="big">Shorty</span> is a simple tool for creating shorter, human- readable links from long URLs. You install Shorty on <span class="bold">your server</span>, so the links you create with it <span class="bold">never go away</span>. You can also manage your links and see <span class="bold">how often people click</span> on them.
