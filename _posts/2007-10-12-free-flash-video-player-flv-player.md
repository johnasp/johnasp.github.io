If like you me, you are involved in Video Streaming production, the viewing of videos encoded in the Flash FLV format isnt a straightforward as you would have thought. You can&#8217;t just double click the FLV to preview it, you need an external player, and this Free FLV Player is just the ticket!

It also displays important video properties of the stream such as the encoding video and audio bitrate&#8217;s.
