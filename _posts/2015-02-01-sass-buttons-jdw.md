#### Overview

A flexible website button system I wrote in SASS and inline SVG which was to be used as a component in a style guide for the client.  The main features of this button set were:

1. The ability to be able to change the entire colour scheme by changing a single SASS variable, this included changing gradients.  This was important as each website brand the client rand had it's own distinct colours.
2. A single base font variable could be changed to instantly change the size of the buttons
3. The buttons icons were created with inline SVG which meant the icons were fluid and resized in situ according to size of their bounding container.
