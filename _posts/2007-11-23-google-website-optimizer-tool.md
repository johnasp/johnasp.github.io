Google Optimizer is the latest in the amazing free arsenal of free tools from Google, the aim of which is to help you increase your web site converstion rates and ultimately you or your companies ROI. The [Google Website Optimizer overview video](http://services.google.com/training/websiteoptimizeroverview/2995095/index.html) tells you all you need to know to get started and here&#8217;s a link to the [Google Website Optimizer](http://adwords.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=61145) main page.

It basically allows you to create several different versions of a web page (which you design) which has some sort of &#8216;call to action&#8217; and will then randomly serve these variations of the page to your users. It will then report to you which was the most effective in terms of conversation rates and will ultimately increase your ROI. Pretty interesting to see how good (or crap) your web pages are at achieving their goals!
