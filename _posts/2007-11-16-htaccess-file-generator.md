A handy tool you can use to generate a .htaccess file. Very useful if you are running an Apache web server &#8211; NB &#8211; This doesn&#8217;t work on sites hosted on IIS.

[.htaccess Generator :: Webmaster Toolkit](http://www.webmaster-toolkit.com/htaccess-generator.shtml)

Also, I found quite a good [.htaccess tutorial](http://www.freewebmasterhelp.com/tutorials/htaccess/) to give you a good grounding of what you can and cant do with the file.
