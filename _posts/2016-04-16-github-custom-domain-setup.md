#### Overview

Kiddicare are a multi-channel retailer specialising in baby products who Morrisons acquired in 2014.  I was placed as UX lead on a project to convert and re-design the existing Kiddicare website into a responsive site.

#### Wireframes

Working in conjunction with a business analyst, I produced wireframes of all  key screens at mobile, tablet and desktop views.  The wireframes were built with Balsamiq, with which I created click-able regions in order that a sample user journey could be followed in a meeting demonstration.

I also exported the screens as JPG’s which I pinned to the walls of project design meeting, the purpose of which to encourage collaborative iterations of the positioning, prominence and inclusion of screen elements.  Samples of the wireframes I produced can be seen by viewing the gallery below:

#### Responsive Prototype

The proposed design for the layout of the new homepage involved a complicated product grid (similar to Pinterest) which was supposed to be used to display product module screen elements of different shapes and sizes.

The behaviour of this layout grid at different screen sizes was proving difficult to convey to stakeholders in static wireframes form.  To resolve this problem, I decided to build a working HTML prototype of the homepage and display this in a browser.  I built the working prototype using the <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Foundation front-end development framework</a> and distributed this to stakeholders and also demo’d it in a project meeting.

You can view a video demo of the prototype in the player below or you can view the prototype in a web browser by <a href="">clicking this link</a>.

#### Visual Design

I was also responsible for producing visual design concepts for the new look and feel of the new website.  A few samples of the desktop views I designed can be seen by viewing the gallery below:
