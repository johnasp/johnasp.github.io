Not a tool as such, more of a technique to place a footer at the bottom of a page using CSS. Ahh, this used to be a piece of cake in that halcyon days of table based design, but is pretty tricky in CSS based layout. This good article called [FooterStickAlt from the Man In Blue](http://www.themaninblue.com/writing/perspective/2005/08/29/) should solve a lot of problems, I know it has for me.
