Tutorial of how to use WordPress as a CMS and Blog

  1. Install WordPress into your root directory as normal.
  2. Create a new ‘page’ called &#8220;Home&#8221;.
  3. Then, create a new page called &#8220;Blog&#8221;. Make sure the slug is &#8220;blog&#8221;
  4. Go so Settings > Reading and change the ‘Front page displays’ to Static and select your new pages, &#8220;Home&#8221; and &#8220;Blog&#8221;
  5. Go to Settings > Permalinks and change to a custom structure.
  
    This can be any structure you want but should begin with ‘/blog/’ &#8211; for
  
    example, you will normally want it to be like this ‘/blog/%postname%’
  
    (if this does not work, you may have to fix the permissions on your
  
    .htaccess file. (check out <a style="cursor: pointer;" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Permalinks" target="_blank">Permalinks</a> over at WordPress’ support forum.
  6. That’s it &#8211; you’re done! How easy was that!
  7. Now, obviously you need to make sure that you have a link set up somewhere on your site to go to www.yourdomain.com/blog/
