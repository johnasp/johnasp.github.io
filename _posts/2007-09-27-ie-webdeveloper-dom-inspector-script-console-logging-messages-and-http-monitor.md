Im on a IE tip this evening&#8230;.youve all heard of Firebug, the excellent DOM inspector for Firefox right? Well this is soimething similar for IE, I was wanting the same Firebug functionality for IE when trying to fix an annoying quirk IE was doing when developing a site and stumbled across this on my search of the t&#8217;internet.

V.useful &#8211; enjoy!
