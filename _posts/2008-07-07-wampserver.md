I&#8217;ve been trying to setup and configure PHP, Apache, MySQL , and phpMyAdmin on my PC to install wordpress and christ almighty, talk about painful! I think you need a degree in computer science to get it all up and running!

After pulling my hair out for nearly two days I have just stumbled across this gem of a package called WAMP. It contains everything you need in single install with a handy GUI menu to make the installation and configuration a million times easier.
