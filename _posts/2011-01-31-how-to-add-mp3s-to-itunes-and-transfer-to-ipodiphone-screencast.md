During my day job at the company I work for, we publish audio training speeches (in MP3 format) on our web site to inspire and motivate a network of independent distributors who are associated with the company.   I was recently tasked with educating non tech-savy user how to get these MP3 speeches onto their iPod/iPhones so users can listen to these speeches when on the go.

I am personally a big fan of video screencasts for my own software and tech training requirements and regularly use them to learn new skills, so I thought I would produce my own screencast to show users how to  to add MP3&#8217;s to iTunes and subsequently onto iPod/iPhone.  I researched the best software program to achieve this goal and decided to use Camtasia Studio and subsequently downloaded a trial version to use in my demo.

Anyway, without further ado, here is my first attempt at creating an online screencast/training video, accompanied with my dulcet tones!
