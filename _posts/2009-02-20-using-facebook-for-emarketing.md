A snippet of a good Sitepoint.com article I have just read regarding your <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/newsletter/viewissue.php?id=2&issue=434" target="_blank">marketing your business on Facebook</a>.Â  See the full post here.

&#8212;

The one I&#8217;m focusing on today, however, is Facebook Pages. The [Facebook Terms of Use](http://www.facebook.com/terms.php?ref=pf) prohibit organizations to have their own profiles, unlike individuals. Your options as an organization are better served with Pages, which are open to anyone to use.

You can create a company page from within your individual profile by clicking on the [Advertising](http://www.facebook.com/advertising/?share#/advertising/?src=pf) __link in the footer. By choosing a category, naming the page, and completing a number of fields, your page will be created. You can then share it with others, and they can choose to _Become a fan_.

As people become fans of your organization&#8217;s page, it appears within their _News Feed_, revealing to the rest of their Facebook colleagues that you have added the page. It then links the page name with your page, driving more people to click on the link and have a look.

This is where your page can win or lose. I suggest that you consider your Facebook page as a micro-site; you should start adding more content to the page, encourage conversation within the discussion board, and ask fans to promote it using the Share feature.

Here are a few examples of how SitePoint _Tribune_ readers are using Facebook Pages as part of their marketing strategy.

[OntarioColleges.ca](http://www.ontariocolleges.ca/) uses its [Facebook Page](http://www.facebook.com/pages/ontariocollegesca/39109331935) to share details of events (120 events listed at the time of writing), as well as link their find-a-college program using a large graphic in the center of the page. They have also linked YouTube videos and lively discussion on their Wall and Discussion Board. Janice Henshall from ontariocolleges.ca says &#8220;With our _fan_ base steadily increasing, we&#8217;re hoping that our target demographic (potential college applicants, many who are between 18 and 24 years of age) find it a useful communication tool. Time will tell.&#8221;

Chinese nightlife web site, [Zhuhai Nights](http://www.zhuhainights.com/) uses their [Facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Zhuhai-Nights-The-Definitive-Guide-to-Life-After-Dark-in-Zhuhai-China/18927643382) as a promotional tool to drive people to their web site. They have many videos (including fan videos) and photos to build rich content within the page.

Mark Clulow from Coos Creations, creators of the site, states &#8220;We use the page to generate interest and tell people about events. The most popular feature though, is photo tagging. Tagging people in photos from events we&#8217;re involved with lets them know about the site, as well as their friends and family &#8212; all in a subtle but effective way. Actually watermarking the photos with Facebook has proven very successful at dragging people over to our site.&#8221;

Chicago web design business, [Addicott Web](http://www.addicottweb.com/) has a [Facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/home.php#/pages/Chicago-IL/Addicott-Web/39528089662) to market their services to a wider audience. Hirsch Fishman from Addicott has a few great ideas on how to better utilize Facebook Pages for web professionals.

&#8220;I set up a Facebook page because I wanted to directly market my web design business to everyone I know on Facebook. The vast majority of my clients come through word of mouth, but only a few of these know about my web site. Then there are people where it&#8217;s been years since I&#8217;ve spoken to them so they&#8217;re unaware of what I&#8217;m up to now. Posting on the Facebook page allows for these situations &#8212; and help fuel the word of mouth and referrals that might come my way.

Overall my goal has to been to create a well-rounded marketing piece for Addicott Web on the Facebook page. As much as my web site serves that purpose, if people don&#8217;t visit, then it&#8217;s pointless. With so many people on Facebook, it seemed the perfect approach.

What am I doing in particular on my page?

  * I import my RSS feed to it, so that all blog posts display on Facebook as soon as I post them on my blog.
  * I&#8217;ve been using the photo gallery as my portfolio and in the caption of each web site that I feature, post the complete project details, taken word-for-word from my actual web site.
  * I&#8217;ve asked some past clients to post positive reviews of my work.
  * I specifically invite new clients to _Become a fan_ of my Facebook page so that they can see all of this information (if they&#8217;ve yet to look at my web site).

The most positive aspect of all is that it&#8217;s given me a potential service that I can now offer clients as well &#8212; creating and consulting on their Facebook presence as a complement to the web site that I&#8217;m creating for them. Being able to offer services like this helps me as a professional, as I can offer clients more than just a web site &#8212; and that&#8217;s the value proposition of my business.&#8221;

Thanks for your feedback and suggestions, Janice, Mark, and Hirsch. It&#8217;s great to see businesses using a variety of methods on their Facebook Pages to increase their fan base and interact with audiences.

I trust this article has you thinking about how better to market your organization using Facebook Pages &#8212; best of luck with it!
