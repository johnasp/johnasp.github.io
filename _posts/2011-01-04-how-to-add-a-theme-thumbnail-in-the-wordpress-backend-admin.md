I have just been pulling my hair out trying to find out how to add a thumbnail image to the  &#8216;Themes&#8217;  area in the  Wordress backend admin tool.  This aint documented ANYWHERE on t&#8217;internet &#8211; or if it is, I can&#8217;t find it!

I now, however, thanks to my friend [Dan Whiteside (aka &#8216;SFB&#8217;) at Nenuno Creative](http://nenuno.co.uk/creative/), have the answer, so I thought Id blog about it and share the love! Here&#8217;s how you do it:

<!--more-->

  1. Created your theme screenshot/thumnbail file in your graphics package and call it screen it **screenshot.png**
  2. ****Make the image dimension 300&#215;225 (this isnt set in stone, it can be any size but this seems to be the standard)
  3. Drop your file in the root folder of your theme, for example:
  
    C:\wamp\www\example.com\wp-content\themes\yourThemeName\screenshot.png
  4. Login to the WordPress backend and go APPEARANCE &#8211; THEMES and et voila, you will see your screenshot image of your theme in all its glory!
