Feng-GUI service is an automatic alternative to [eye-tracking](http://www.feng-gui.com/faq.htm#quality){.top_menu}.

See which area of your website get most of the attention. This artificial intelligence service simulates the human vision and creates an attention heatmap and it claims to be 70% accurate. See their comparison charts on the site. 

This is a cost effective solution to generating heatmaps.
