#### Overview

Kiddicare are a multi-channel retailer specialising in baby products who Morrisons acquired in 2014.  I was placed as UX lead on a project to convert and re-design the existing Kiddicare website into a responsive site.

#### Prototype

The proposed design for the layout of the new homepage involved a complicated product grid (similar to Pinterest) which was supposed to be used to display product module screen elements of different shapes and sizes.

The behaviour of this layout grid at different screen sizes was proving difficult to convey to stakeholders in static wireframe form.  To resolve this problem, I decided to build a <a href="/protos/kiddicare/demo.html">working HTML prototype of the homepage</a> and demonstrate this direct in a web browser.  

The prototype was built using the <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Foundation</a> framework and can be viewed by <a href="/protos/kiddicare/demo.html">clicking this link</a>.

#### Visual Design

I was also responsible for producing visual design concepts for the new look and feel of the new website.  A few samples of the desktop views I designed can be seen by viewing the gallery below:

#### Wireframes

Working in conjunction with a business analyst, I produced wireframes of all  key screens at mobile, tablet and desktop views, and also created click-able regions in order that a sample user journey could be followed in a  demonstration.

I also exported the screens as JPGâ€™s which I pinned to the walls of project design meeting, the purpose of which to encourage collaborative iterations of the positioning, prominence and inclusion of screen elements.  Samples of the wireframes I produced can be seen by viewing the gallery below:
