Tell Google, MSN, Yahoo, etc, how to find your XML Sitemap with Sitemaps Autodiscovery. This is something I have just implemented at work, not a tool as such but I thought it was a pretty important/useful piece of information.

Search engines will check your  [robots.txt file](http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/exclusion.html#robotstxt) for a link to an XML sitemap file, then get the file from that location. This is a big plus because all the major search engines regularly check robots.txt files as part of their ordinary crawling. My Robots.txt file now does all the work for me in telling all the major search engines where to find my XML sitemap.
