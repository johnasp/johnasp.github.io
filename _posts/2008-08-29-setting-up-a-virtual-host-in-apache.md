I&#8217;ve been trying and failing to get my local Apache server configured to run several of my web sites locally on a single instance of Apache. Their online documentation is very obviouslly written by geeks for geeks and is difficuly to fathom out.

Luckily I found this well written and straightfoward guide to what I wanted to achieved and I was up and running in no time. Back of the net!
