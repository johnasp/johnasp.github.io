## Project Overview

The company has a digital colonoscopy scoping tool which is used to remotely connect multiple surgeons to collaboratively diagnose a patient's bowel cancer condition.  The goal of the this project were:

1. Make the application more intuitive and easy to use under surgery conditions.
2. Add and cater for several new features within the UI.
3. Redesign the UI with the rules of a new company design system

### My Role

I was the UX lead in this project team and worked with a business analyst, managed a junior designer and was responsible for the following: 

* Gathering business requirements and mapping these out to user stories
* User persona research and creation
* User research and user testing (surgeons) 
* UI and Prototype design
* Front end development for web based prototype and production front end code

### Deliverables

####  Prototype - Figma

You can view the scope application prototype I designed by either [viewing a video of me following the user journey](https://youtu.be/SMm1T1By0CY), or you can attempt to follow the journey yourself by using the embedded Figma component below:

**NB** - There is a certain user journey flow you must take through the app, if you want to interact with it, details of which I have pasted below the prototype.

25. Go into full screen mode (what elements do we want to leave on screen at this state?)
26. Return to normal screen size 
27. Exit with saving anything
28. Complete the session

#### Prototype - Web

I wrote the front end code (HTML/SASS/CSS/JS) which was used in a web based prototype and also in production for the web application which you can view by watching the video below, or interact with it yourself on this [fully interactive web prototype](https://johnaspinall.co.uk/scope2/).

You can view the prototype below and/or <a href="https://github.com/johnasp/scope2.0">view the source code on this Github repo</a>.

### Results

The new Scope software was implmented, deployed and rolled into surgeries throughout the world.  The new features of the application have now opened up new markets for the business, particularly in the massive India medicare market. It has allowed additional revenue streams to be opened up in the form of the live broadcasts operation to students for training purposes and has ultimately improved patient cancer diagnosis and treatment.
