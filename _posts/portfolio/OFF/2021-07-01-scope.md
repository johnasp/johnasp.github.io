## Project Overview

The company has a digital colonoscopy scoping tool which is used to remotely connect multiple surgeons to collaboratively diagnose a patient's bowel cancer condition.  The goal of the this project were:

Make the application more intuitive and easy to use under surgery conditions.
Add and cater for several new features within the UI.
Redesign the UI with the rules of a new company design system

### My Role

I was the UX lead in this project team and worked with a business analyst, managed a junior designer and was responsible for the following: 

Gathering business requirements and mapping these out to user stories
User persona research and creation
User research and user testing (surgeons) 
UI and Prototype design
Front end development for web based prototype and production front end code

### Deliverables

#### Figma Prototype

You can view the Figma prototype I designed below.  There is a certain user journey flow you must take through the app if you want to interact with it, details of which I have pasted below the prototype.

#### Coded Prototype

I wrote the front end code (HTML/SASS/CSS/JS) which I used to create <a href="/scope2/index.htm">this web based prototype</a>.  This code was also in production for the web application.  You can view the prototype by clicking here or <view href="https://github.com/johnasp/scope2.0">view the source code on this Github repo</a>. 



### Results

The new features of the application have now opened up new markets (particularly the Indian markets) for the business, allowed additional revenue streams to be opened up in the form of live broadcasts operation to students, and ultimately improved patient cancer diagnosis and treatment, which is the overall goal.
