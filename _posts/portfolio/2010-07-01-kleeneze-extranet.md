Lead web developer on inceptor of a project to build a content managed, distributor private internet site (the Kleeneze 'Distributor Support Arena')

The then existing extranet site was a flat file HTML site and had no content management system.  All (no matter how trivial) content updates had to therefore come through the site manager, which was also me.

The site content very difficult to keep updated as common site sections (such as the header, footer, navigation, etc) were not split up and included as partials.  This meant that even a simple update, such as a menu item edit, resulted in  every single file being updated, and there were hundreds of files.  

### My solution

I knew this whole situation was crazy and frustrated both myself by having to perform the monotonous work and the business section owners were also frustrated by the fact they were not in charge of their own content and it sometimes quite some time for a requested change to be actioned.

I knew some Wordpress and suggested that use it as a CMS to replace the existing "system".  After further research to its capabilities, I presented the possibilities and benefits of a new Wordpress based CMS to the directors and the head of IT and got the go ahead to build the new system.

### The results

The new system reduced a massive content update bottleneck as it allowed each department in the organisation to update their own content, which led a massive improvement in the free flowing of vital information to the companies distributor network.

### What I did

* Converted the existing distributor website from a static, file based HTML system into a dynamic, CMS solution powered by Wordpress.
* Customised a child theme out of an existing theme to bring the system to life quicker.
* Wrote PHP, HTML and CSS to achieve the above
* Installed Wordpress on a WAMP stack on my own computer (and on my staff members machine)
* Configured Wordpress, MySQL and PHP
* Imported all content into the database
* Setup system user accounts
* Trained content authors in how to update their sections of the site

### Cash savings

My Wordpress solution saved the company money to the tune of Â£100K+ as an external contractor was trying to get the company to invest in IBM Websphere to essentially just be used a CMS.  

My 'free' open source Wordpress implementation saved the company a forthune in both licence and consultancy fees which was something I was quite proud of.
