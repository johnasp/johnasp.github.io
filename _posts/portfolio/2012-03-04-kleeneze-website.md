<strong>Web designer, developer, CMS developer</strong> on project to redesign the Kleeneze corporate website and make it responsive.  The goal of which was to generate more website leads and optimise for mobile and tablet platforms. 

Tasks completed included; production of wireframes and a rapid prototype, designed site mock-ups, coded the HTML & CSS (using responsive design) and co-worked to convert into a Wordpress theme, thus making the site content managed. 

The site has since had a couple of design iterations but you can view the archived version by clicking the image below.
