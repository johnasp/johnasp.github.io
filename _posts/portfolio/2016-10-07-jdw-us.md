Ground up build of the new JDWilliams USA website using the Hybris platform as a part of the company-wide digital transformation program. This work was approached with the "mobile first" philosophy and utilised the Bootstrap framework.

*Directly responsible for:*

* Developing responsive template components.
* Focus was on building the mobile view components including the off canvas menus, product size guide, product list and product detail pages. 
* Wrote HTML, CSS, Jquery and LESS for the aforementioned templates.
