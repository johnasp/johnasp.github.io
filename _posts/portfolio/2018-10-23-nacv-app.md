Completed the visual design (in Adobe Illustrator) for a UI redesign of the "Not a CV" native application, specifically used for the iOS platform.  Also built a prototype of the application in Invision to be shown to stakeholders and also shared with the app developer. 

Here is a PDF file containing <a href="img/nacv-app-screen-designs.pdf">high res shots of all the app screens </a>.
