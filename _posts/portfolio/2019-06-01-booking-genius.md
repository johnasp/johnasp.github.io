* **Client:** Booking.com
* **Date:** 1st April 2020
* **Project:**  Multiple UX & UI projects including Google PPC double serving differentiation, Genius program, post booking UX & UI improvements and RTL language implementation of Booking.com headers
* **Goal:** Improve conversion rate by at least 5% for user in this sales funnel 

### The client & projects

Booking.com have a transport division called “Cars” and I worked on multiple projects during my year long contract working with the company, which I'll discuss below:

### Google PPC 'double serving' differentiation

Booking.com generates revenues by taking commisions (from its many car hire company partners) by presenting car rental listings on its website, and eventually by receiving a booking.  Booking also owns a brand called Rentalcars.com which essentially follows the same business model.  

Both brands generate the vast majority of their sales leads by bidding on Google Adwords PPC search terms (such as "car hire","rent a car", etc) campaigns and both brans bid for the same search terms in order to appear top of the Google seach results pages (in the Ad slots).  Both brands websites were essentially the same layouts but with a different them applied and Google specifically does not allow this practice and refers to it as "double serving" and had informed Booking that they would be kicked out of the PPC program for all the major car hire serach terms if they did not adhere to these rules, the financial impact of which would be severe.

#### Project goal
So the project was, therefore, was to produce visually different rental car search and book user journies for Booking Cars from that of RentalCars.com. This was to ensure the designs were visually different to that of RentalCars whilst not letting the conversion rates dip by more than 3% (the business had appreciate that there would likely be a conversion rate drop off due to the redesign of pages).

#### My role
This was a substantial project and I worked in a multi-disciplinary agile project team composed of BA’s, UX Designers, UI Designers, Testers and Developers. I fulfilled the role of mobile UI Designer and my main goals were to illustrate the new screen designs at various stages in the user journies.   

The designs I worked on were also to be used as assets in the production of prototypes used for stakeholder demonstations and also in user testing sessions.

### Genius progam mobile app

Booking.com initiated a brand new loyalty program called “Genius” whereby a user was rewarded with points the more car rental bookings he or she made. These points could then be redeemed with discounts and special deals offered to users on future bookings offers.  I was tasked with designing  prototypes for Cars mobile app which illustrated this new functionality.  A sample of one section of the prototypes I developed can be viewed below:

The prototype I designed and produced was used in user testing sessions to validate the product.  Following a couple of rounds of iterative redesign, based on the user testing feedback, the prototype was signed off and sent to the development team for production and eventual release into the mobile app.
