excerpt: Mobile and desktop eCommerce interaction design - integrating new 'genius' loyalty program for Booking.com Transport division.
---

## Project Overview

Booking.com have a transport division called “Cars” and they initiated a brand new loyalty program called “Genius” whereby a user was rewarded with points the more car rental bookings he or she made. These points could then be redeemed with discounts on future bookings and were also given other special offers.  

### My Role

Worked in a multi-disciplinary agile project team composed of BA’s, UX Designers, UI Designers, Testers and Developers. I fulfilled the role of mobile UI Designer and my main goals were to illustrate the user journeys to stakeholders by producing web flow diagrams, designing the mobile web application screens and produced an interactive prototype based on these screens.

### My Deliverables

* Web flow diagrams to illustrate the proposed user journeys.  <a href="/pdf/genius-amend-extras.pdf">Sample of the 'amend booking' web flow diagram can be viewed here.</a> 
* UI design screens of the above journeys, utlising the company design system.
* Designed prototype for the Genius program mobile app, video demo below.

### Results

The prototype I designed and produced was used in user testing sessions to validate the product.  Following a couple of rounds of iterative redesign, based on the user testing feedback, the prototype was signed off and sent to the development team for production and eventual release.
