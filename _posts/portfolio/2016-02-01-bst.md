I was approached by the Blackpool Supporters' Trust to help them create a membership website amd content management system for their organisation.

BST's
 existing website didn't have the capabilities for its members to create and manage their membership accounts nor allow it to manage its content.  I suggested they use Wordpress coupled with a membership plugin which met the functionality of their requirements.
