<strong>Website designer, developer and Wordpress CMS developer </strong> of on a project build a national database of publicly accessible traffic cameras from accross the UK.

View Traffic is a website for locating traffic cameras throughout the UK.  I was tasked with designing a building the site in a way in which the site owner could maintain the content, in addition to being able to add new traffic cameras.

I built the site using Wordpress as the backend CMS and created a cusom theme.  I also performed some SEO work on the site a later date which yielded a considerable ROI for the work as ad click through rates increased by a considerable margin.

### Update

This website was bought out by a competitor and the site owner made a very good return return on his intial investment in the site i.e. my development costs.  The site was incororated by its new owner and is no longer live although you can view select pages from the site using the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100828152840/http://www.viewtraffic.info/">WayBack Machine</a> internet archive.
