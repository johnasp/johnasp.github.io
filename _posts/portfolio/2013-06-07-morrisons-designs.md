excerpt: Visual design concepts of Morrisons.com website
---

I joined the Morrisons Digital team in Manchester as an <strong>innovation UX developer</strong> to work on the brand new eCommerece platform and website the company was about to create. 

I worked on creating the visual designs and front end development code of the new site, in addition to working on the Kiddicare brand. 

The designs and code were unfortunately never put into production as mid project, the business made a decision to acquire Ocado and use their existing platform. 

I have  misplaced the full set of concepts, although I do have the homepage which can be viewed above.  After a few iterations, the designs were well received at Bradford HQ and met with board approval.
