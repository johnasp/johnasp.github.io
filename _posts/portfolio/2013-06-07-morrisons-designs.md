excerpt: Visual design concepts of Morrisons.com website
---

I joined the Morrisons Digital team in Manchester as an <strong>innovation UX developer</strong> to work on the brand new eCommerece platform and website the company was about to create. 

I worked on creating the visual designs and front end development code of the new site, in addition to working on the Kiddicare brand. 

The designs and code were unfortunately never put into production as mid project, the business made a decision to acquire Ocado and use their existing platform. 

I have  misplaced the full set of concepts, although I do have the homepage which can be viewed above.  After a few iterations, the designs were well received at Bradford HQ and met with board approval. 

### Kidicare native app web forms

Another small piece of work I did while working at Morrisons, was to build some web form views for a native app we were building for the Kiddicare brand

This was only a small piece of work but was quite a useful exercise learning nonetheless, as this was a standalone piece of code to write, it allowed me to put the new SASS and Compass framework skills I had been learning, into practice.  

#### Live demo

Click each of the two images below to load the respective form page in a browser.  This demo is hosted on this site.  

<div class="row">
	<div class="col-xs-6">
		<a href="{{ base }}/kiddicare-login-screens/register.htm"><img src="{{ base }}/img/portfolio/kiddicare-forms-thumb.png" alt="Kiddicare mobile registeration screen"></a>
	</div>
	<div class="col-xs-6">
		<a href="{{ base }}/kiddicare-login-screens/login.htm">
		<img src="{{ base }}/img/portfolio/kk-login-thumb.jpg" alt="Kiddicare mobile login screen"></a>
	</div>
</div>

The forms were both used as a webview on the Kiddicare apps created for iOS and Android.
