excerpt: Front end login and registration forms for Kiddicare app
caption: Front-End Dev
---

<strong>Front end developer</strong> building the web view login and registration forms used on the Kiddicare iOS and Android apps.

This was only a small piece of work but was quite a useful exercise learning nonetheless, as this was a standalone piece of code to write, it allowed me to put the new SASS and Compass framework skills I had been learning, into practice.  

#### Live demo

Click each of the two images below to load the respective form page in a browser.  This demo is hosted on this site.  

<div class="row">
	<div class="col-xs-6">
		<a href="{{ base }}/kiddicare-login-screens/register.htm"><img src="{{ base }}/img/portfolio/kiddicare-forms-thumb.png" alt="Kiddicare mobile registeration screen"></a>
	</div>
	<div class="col-xs-6">
		<a href="{{ base }}/kiddicare-login-screens/login.htm">
		<img src="{{ base }}/img/portfolio/kk-login-thumb.jpg" alt="Kiddicare mobile login screen"></a>
	</div>
</div>

The forms were both used as a webview on the Kiddicare apps created for iOS and Android.
