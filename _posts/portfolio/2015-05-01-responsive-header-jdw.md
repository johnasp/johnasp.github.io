---  

Part of the workflow at JD Williams was to prototype new site components for iterative review and development, prior to launch.  I was involved in prototyping a responsive main menu navigation system and a mobile view clothing size guide. 

I decided the best way to approach the production of these prototypes was to build them in the browser and use the "mobile first" philosophy. 

### Responsive site header and menu 

I took a screen recording of the final prototype in action which you can view below.  You can alternatively view the working prototype in your browser and device of choice by <a href="http://johnasp.github.io/ecommerce_responsive_header/">clicking this link</a>.
