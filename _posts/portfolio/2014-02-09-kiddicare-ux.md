<strong>UX lead</strong> on a project to convert and re-design the existing Kiddicare website into a responsive site.   

Kiddicare are a multi-channel retailer specialising in baby products who Morrisons acquired in 2014, for whom I was working for at the time. 

*Directly responsible for:*

* Converting business requirements into wireframes
* Homepage rapid prototype
* Visual design for web page concepts

### Wireframes

Working in conjunction with a business analyst, I produced wireframes of all  key screens at mobile, tablet and desktop views, and also created click-able regions in order that a sample user journey could be followed in a demonstration.

I also exported the screens as JPGâ€™s which I pinned to the walls of project design meeting, the purpose of which to encourage collaborative iterations of the positioning, prominence and inclusion of screen elements.  

Samples of the wireframes I produced can be viewed below:

  </li>
</ul>

### Prototype

The proposed design for the layout of the new homepage involved a complicated product grid (similar to Pinterest).

The behaviour of this layout grid, particularly at different screen sizes, was proving difficult to convey to stakeholders in static wireframe form.  

To resolve this problem, I built a <a href="/protos/kiddicare/demo.html"> HTML prototype of the homepage</a> (using the Foundation framework) and demonstrated this direct in a web browser.  This prototype helped in stakeholder understanding of the interface and in achieving sign off.

### Visual Design

I was also responsible for producing visual design concepts for the look and feel of the new website, examples of which can be seen below.

### Front end development

I was also responsible for building on the front end code for the production website.  The company has since been sold and taken over and the site no longer live so I unfortunately cannot link to the finished version.
