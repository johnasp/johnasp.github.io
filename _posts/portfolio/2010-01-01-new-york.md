Website to support distributor incetive desination to New York in 2011.  I produced the visual design and front end coding for the site.

The purpose of this site was to encourage the companies' sales network to make X amount of sales in the sales period in order to get an all expenses paid trip to New York. 

### What I did

Established the design concept, wrote the code and managed its deployment onto an Apache web server.
