Website to support distributor incetive desination to Hong Kong in 2010.  I produced the visual design and front end coding for the site.

The purpose of this site was to encourage the companies' sales network to make X amount of sales in the sales period in order to get an all expenses paid trip to Hong Kong. 

### What I did

To establish the design concept for this piece of work, I researched Hong Kong imagery on the internet and came up with he concept of "old meets new" mixing the fascinating historical traditiond of old Hong Kong with the neon lights of the exciting, ultra modern new world.  

I used a large nighttime cityscape image as the site background, used a an oriental logo and header text font, quill and parchment for the body text and faux neon lights for the site navigation. 

I also wrote all the front end code, tested it and managed its deployment onto an Apache web server.

#### Update 

The site is longer live as it was time based but can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110302084838/http://www.hongkong2010.co.uk/">viewed here</a> on the WayBack Machine internet archive.
