UI redesign of the "Not a CV" native application, specifically used for the iOS platform.  Also built a prototype of the application in Adobe XD to be shown to stakeholders and also shared with the app developer to illustrate the application flow. 

### Prototype
A <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/embed/9848c62e-f8fb-4b46-4343-24379329a8cd-ee79/"> prototype </a> I built of the app screens in Adobe XP which I shared with the stakeholders and iOS developer.
