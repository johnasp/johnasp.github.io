A free and easy to use XML and XSL editor. The good thing about this tool is that you edit your XML and XSL in different tabs and run the transformation at the click of a button to see if your files are valid and it transforms how you would expect (or not!) You can use it in conjunction with several XSL transformation engines, should you so desire.
