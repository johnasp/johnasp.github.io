This isn&#8217;t a tool or application as such, but it&#8217;s such a handy little trick for a web designer to use I thought I&#8217;d post it here. This is an excellent article that shows you how to show/hide DIVs on a web page by using some clever and simple JavaScript.

Although you are show and hiding content, it will not have a nagative impact on your SEO as Google with still index all the pages content using this method.
