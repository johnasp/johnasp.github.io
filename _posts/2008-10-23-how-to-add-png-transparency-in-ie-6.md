I&#8217;ve recently stumbled upon this excellent method for getting PNG files to display alpha transparency in IE6.Â  A verg elegant solution compared to other botch jobs I&#8217;ve used in the past:

[http://www.twinhelix.com/css/iepngfix/](http://www.twinhelix.com/css/iepngfix/ "IE 6 PNG transparency fix")

This script adds near-native PNG support with alpha opacity to IE 5.5 and 6. Now you can have full translucency and no more ugly grey borders! It requires only one line in your CSS file, and no changes to your website HTML. <IMG> tags and background images are both supported.
