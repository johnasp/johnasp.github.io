I&#8217;ve just been tasked with training all members of our department at work on how to use the WordPress CMS I am building for our client Intranet.&nbsp; They say a picture can paint a thousand words, well I believe a picture can paint a million words!&nbsp; 

Therefore, I have decided to produce a series of instructional videos rather than a load of boring text based instructions as I beleive people learn more effectively when actually performing the work themselves rather than being spoon fed.&nbsp; Plus I only have to make the one video and then just distribute it to people &#8211; I&#8217;m just so damn efficient ðŸ˜‰

Anyhow, I&#8217;ve been looking on t&#8217;internet for a free program to achieve my aims and this one is pretty good upon my first impressions, [Cam Studio.](http://camstudio.org/)

I will report further findings upon further use of the product!
