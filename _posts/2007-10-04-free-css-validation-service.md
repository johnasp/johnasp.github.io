<span style="font-family:georgia;">I have sometimes been pulling my hair out as why a certain page element isn&#8217;t displaying as it should and quite often this can be down to an easily typed and difficult to spot syntax error in your </span><span style="font-family:georgia;" class="blsp-spelling-error">CSS</span> <span style="font-family:georgia;">file. When I come across such unexplainable problems I regularly validate my </span><span style="font-family:georgia;" class="blsp-spelling-error">CSS</span> just to make sure &#8211; it&#8217;s also good practice to do so regardless!

Validate your site <span class="blsp-spelling-error">CSS</span> file(s) with the following free validation service from the <span class="blsp-spelling-error">goodfellah&#8217;s</span> at the W3C. You can validate it against different versions of the <span class="blsp-spelling-error">CSS</span> standard, the medium for which the <span class="blsp-spelling-error">sylesheet</span> is to be embedded to and various different warning reports, so blaze away on the link below! You can even place a <span class="blsp-spelling-error">CSS</span> valid button on your site and everything when you are valid &#8211; which is nice.

[The W3C <span class="blsp-spelling-error">CSS</span> Validation Service](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

PS &#8211; This site is <span class="blsp-spelling-error">CSS</span> valid, naturally!
