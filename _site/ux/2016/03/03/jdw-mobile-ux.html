<h4 id="overview">Overview</h4>

<p>On the clients’ mobile specific website, the product and search user experience was poor and deemed to be causing a high bounce rate in the add to bag user journey.  This was having a detrimental affect on the sites turnover and causing a loss of revenues.</p>

<p>Users often struggled to both find and refine facets of products they were searching for.  Product refinements had to be made via a series of unintuitive drop down menus which didn’t lend itself well to a touch screen experience.</p>

<p>Users also tended to rely on typed search and appeared blind to the browse categories button, which afforded a more linear and touch friendly approach to product search. Additionally, typed search journeys did not always yield accurate results.</p>

<p>To illustrate the issues with the old site, I recorded a video of myself navigating products and making refinements, which can be viewed below:</p>

<h4 id="discovery--research">Discovery &amp; Research</h4>

<p>To gain an understanding of how our competitors approached mobile search and navigation, I compiled a list of industry key players and followed a user search journey on each of these sites. I screen recorded each of these sessions and also took screen prints for post analysis.</p>

<p>I then presented each of these screen recording and prints to project stakeholders, along with my observations. I printed out and pinned the screen shots to the meeting room wall, the purpose of this was to further narrow down the design patterns we wanted to take advantage of.</p>

<p>My analysis helped us craft a short list of interface design patterns to pursue in our product.</p>

<div class="no-margin"><img src="/img/portfolio/competition-wall.jpg" alt="Competitor research wall" /></div>

<h5 id="image---competitor-research-wall">IMAGE - Competitor research wall</h5>

<p>In addition to competitor research, I also conducted a few “quick and dirty” user testing sessions in the form of getting my Mum, partner and her group of friends to attempt to follow the user journey on the existing site.   The results of which were logged and it was noted that they all tended to struggle at the refinement stage and some couldn’t even complete the user journey at all.  This observation was also validated by data in drop offs in the analytics goal funnel.</p>

<h4 id="decisions">Decisions</h4>

<p>The key changes I therefore wanted to make on the new product were derived from the information obtained in the research stage and my own hunches as to what will be effective.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Introduce an industry standard “burger” site menu to house the list of product categories and other navigational links.  This menu would initially be hidden off screen (to the left) and animate in to view upon touch.</li>
  <li>Completely change the refinement interface, remove the drop down menus and implement a refinement grid where users could easily add and remove multiple facet refinements by a single touch.  This menu would also be initially hidden off screen (to the right) and animate into view upon touch.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="visual-design--prototype">Visual design &amp; prototype</h4>

<p>I designed visual concepts of all screens for the new interface (in Adobe Fireworks), samples of which can viewed below.</p>

<ul id="visual-designs">
  <li>
    <a href="#slide1"><img src="/img/portfolio/home.jpg" alt="" /></a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="#slide2"><img src="/img/portfolio/list-page.jpg" alt="This is an awesome jQuery slider plugin." /></a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="#slide3"><img src="/img/portfolio/filter-page.jpg" alt="Check it out, you are going to &lt;span class='red'&gt;♥&lt;/span&gt; it :)" /></a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="#slide4"><img src="/img/portfolio/filter-page2.jpg" alt="Check it out, you are going to &lt;span class='red'&gt;♥&lt;/span&gt; it :)" /></a>
  </li>
</ul>

<h5 id="selection-of-visual-design-concepts">Selection of visual design concepts</h5>

<p>I felt that viewing the screens in the context in which they were designed for (i.e. a mobile device) would help give stakeholders a better appreciation of what the designs would look and behave like on a device, so I created a click-able visual prototype out of the screens using Invision.</p>

<p><a href="https://invis.io/7K22HIYXS">The visual prototype</a> was extremely well received as it gave a clear indication to the mobile look and feel, as I was able to animate transitions, off-canvas menus, sticky headers and the like.</p>

<p>Follow the journey below to interact with the <a href="https://invis.io/7K22HIYXS">visual prototype</a>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select a red dress</li>
  <li>Refine the results to sizes 14 and 16</li>
  <li>Remove size 16 refinement</li>
  <li>View the results again</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="working-prototype">Working prototype</h4>

<p>I have learnt through experience that the only way to accurately see how a mobile web page will both look and perform on a mobile web browser, is to view a complete coded web page direct on a mobile device.</p>

<p>With this in mind, I decided to code a production ready prototype written in HTML, CSS (SASS) and Jquery, whilst utilising Grunt for a build system and Github for source control and Github pages for web hosting.</p>

<p>You can view a video demo of the prototype in action below or <a href="http://johnasp.github.io/search_nav_proto/">access this live URL which houses the fully coded prototype</a>.</p>

<p>NB - If viewing the live demo in a desktop browser, resize your browser window to a mobile viewport size to get a mobile look &amp; feel.</p>

<iframe width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V0m_-bVFMFs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<h5 id="video-demo-of-the-fully-coded-prototype">Video demo of the fully coded prototype</h5>

<p>I published each iteration of the coded prototype to a Github pages URL, which could then be accessed direct on a mobile device web browser.  The prototype URL was then sent to the project stakeholders for feedback after each development iteration.</p>

<p>This work-flow formed a User Centred Design (UCD) feedback loop, as I got the product into the hands of the users (business analysts and internal testers) at the first stage of development and requested feedback after each development iteration until sign off.</p>

<p>The front end code I wrote was used directly in the final product.  I had to pair program with a Java developer who integrated my front end code into the Websphere shop application.</p>

<h4 id="the-final-result">The final result</h4>

<p>Three month following release, financial figures (released from the projects’ business analyst) revealed that the new burger-menu product search, yielded an annual revenue increase of £2,960,000, at the accepted demand level.</p>

<p>The new product refinement system was also estimated to have yielded an increase of £322,000 per annum, at the accepted demand level.</p>

<p>The project was therefore deemed a great financial success as conversion rates had been measured to increase in total by £3.3 million per annum, at the accepted demand level.</p>
