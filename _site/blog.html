              <p><p>A very common task for any web designer (and I’m guessing for a graphic designer as well) working on designing a website mockup or comp is to place imagery within the design, and more often than not (in my experience anyway), you need to cut out the main image and make the background transparent. There are several ways to do this, some cruder than others, but the best method by far is to use masks to remove the background/make it transparent and maintain the original image. This is known as ‘non-destructive’ image removal technique which means you can play around with editing vector points to fine tune the image until you are happy with with it, whilst not destroying the original JPG.</p>
