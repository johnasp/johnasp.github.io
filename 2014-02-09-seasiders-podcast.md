A responsive website I built from scratch to delivery the podcast content I produced for a show I created about Blackpool FC.  

This was third iteration of the site design for the podcast I started in 2010.  The initial site I built was fixed width so I decided to make the site responsive in 2014. 

I wanted to learn about CSS pre-processors at the time of this project, so read a book called <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/sass-and-compass-designers">SASS and Compass by Ben Frain</a> and applied what I learnt when building out the site. 

Ben's other book titled <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1784398934/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=1784398934&linkCode=as2&tag=eborearevroo-21">Responsive Web Design with HTML5 & CSS3</a> also provides a great insight into build modern, responsive sites. 

I was also keen to learn how the "pros" build responsive sites with SASS from the ground up and so purchased and followed this <a href="https://css-tricks.com/lodge/v10/">excellent full site build tutorial</a> from Chris Coyier of CSS Tricks.  I believe this course is now free and highly recommend it. 

Anyway back to business, the following are the key tasks I performed when building this site:

#### What I did

1. Performed a content taxonomy to classify and order all my video, audio and blog content
2. Visual design of the site (in Adobe Fireworks)
3. Coded all the site with a mobile first approach using SASS, Compass, HTML5 and Jquery
4. Converted the site to a custom Wordpress theme and setup the Wordpress installation 
5. Recorded all the podcasts, 126 in total over 5 seasons.
6. Distributed all the content over various social media platforms automatically upon each piece being published.
7. Got accepted into NewsNow publishing platform
8. Had over 45 five star reviews in the iTunes store
9. Wrote the content and planned and managed each new show, which contained three presenters.
10. Organised guests to come on the show, either in studio or via Skype

The show was a great success in the Blackpool fan community.  We had over 500 Facebook page likes, nearly 2,000 Twitter followers and email list with over 200 subsribers.  

The podcast is unfortunately not running at the moment but I hope to revive it one day when the ownership situation at the football club is resolved in one way or another.
